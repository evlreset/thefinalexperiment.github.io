			<h1>World Building</h1>
			The characters are based on greek mythology and musicals, most prominently the Odyssey, the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, the Illiad, <em>Epic: The Musical</em>, and <em>Hadestown</em>.<br>The story takes place in the kingdom of Beriech, its own continent in the middle of the ocean with no neighboring kingdoms/coutnries. The few other countries who do have any contact with Beriech stay away, knowing the kingdom is run by dragons, and not just their royal family consisting of Gold Dragons, but also the Dragon Council.<br>While not as widely known about what they do, everyong accepts the Dragon Council for what they are: a type of shadow government. Although they are not at the top of the political chain either. Each council member has their own territory and a specific crystal.<br>Back to Beriech, it is devided into five "rings," which are a form of caste system. Those who have little money or live in servitude tend to live in the outer rings while wealthier and more powerful individuals live in the center rings. While these rings aren't enforced in any way, it more an unspoken code and frowned upon to live in a different ring than where you "belong." <br>Above the kingdom is five districts, each with different purposes. Education, Politics, Entertainment, Construction, and Military. They stand hundreds of miles above the ground level and exist outside the rings. They also have trams that travel between the districts, allowing days long trips to take only an hour or so. All of the districts are powered by the crystals, and without them, they would crumble.

			<h1>Story Summary</h1>
			The story began with one character, the former black dragon council member who was reduced to his human form after being resurrected through unknown means. Silas finds a changling, Ezra, who happened to steal from the wrong person and finds himself a member of the North army, the strongest and most unkown army in any kingdom. The two set off on a journey to find more about Ezra's past, being assigned to work with another, Valeos, who aspires to join the royal guard. The three find more and more clues and secrets within the dragon council and about an expirement. An expirement that tears mortals and dragons alike to shreds. Valeos quickly leaves, never truly being apart of the investigation and they meet Zania, the Copper Dragon Champion. The three work together through their investigation, finding more and more links (and an odd amount of ink) as they journy, linking all of their pasts together and finding out who is really in control here.
