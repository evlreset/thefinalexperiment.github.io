		<h1>Backstory</h1>
	<p>For the first hundred years of Silas life it was that of an average child. His mother
Erya and father Leon took great care of him trying her best to raise him to do well with
his life. He was frequently brought up to Atlas where he met his best friend Basil and
would grow connections with the other dragons. He became friends with Mazie,
Cadderose, and Eurydice. Silas also had grown close to Mnemosyne due to Eyra being
good friends with her. Silas grew to dislike Juggernaut after he would frequently bully
him and the two would fight due to Silas having a short temper. Silas was happy and
didn't have many worries when he was a child, he just wanted to be with his family and
friends.<br>
This got worse for Silas around when he turned 200 his father suddenly became
more aggressive and abusive to Silas and Erya. Leon would force Silas to grow
stronger and say that he needed to be better if he wanted to take his position on the
council. It was around this time as well that Leon wouldn't let Silas near Eurydice due to
his hatred for Mariz. Silas still wanted to talk to Eurydice because he grew to realize he
loved her but was terrified of what his father would do if he would talk to her. During this
time Silas would run to Basils if his father got bad at home. Eyra and Basil were the two
people in Silas life who were always there for him and he treasured them deeply. Things
stayed this way for 100 years and only got worse when he turned 350.<br>
When Silas was 350 the event that would cause his descent and eventually
losing himself. It was a regular day for Silas; he stayed in the swamp with his mother
and later that day his father had a council meeting so he would be gone for the night.
Silas was relaxing in his family's cabin and his mother was outside practicing magic.
Silas was in his room when he heard a loud crash followed by the scent of smoke. He
rushed outside to see Mariz in his dragon form having his claw through his mothers
chest and when Mariz saw Silas he flew off. Silas ran to his mother crying as he was
trying to figure out what to do. Erya tried to calm Silas down and tell him it was okay and
that she just wanted to hold onto her son in her last moments. Silas spent the whole
night crying until his father got home to see what happened. Leon was enraged and
while Silas was explaining what happened his father only blamed his son for not being
strong enough to protect Erya and Leon flew off. Silas buried his mother near their
home and later that day got the news that his father was killed on Atlas due to him trying
to kill Mariz. Silas stayed in the swamp for a few months without leaving until Basil came
to find him and helped him leave and stay with him for a bit to try to clear his mind.<br>
Silas stayed with Basil until Mnemosyne came to see how he was doing and to
try and get him prepared for his first council meeting. Mnemosyne flew with Silas to
Atlas where he was appointed the new black dragon council member. Silas was quiet
for most of the meeting but he eventually lost his cool and attacked Mariz because he
couldn't handle seeing his mothers killer right across from him. Mariz easily knocked
Silas unconscious and when he woke up was told Atlas wanted to speak to him. Silas
went and for the first time saw Atlas. Due to Silas being still upset refused to bow and
got crystals sent through his legs to make him. Atlas told Silas that he now has to take
over the responsibilities his father once held. One of those was to guard Blackwater but
Atlas told Silas that holding onto it should allow for him to feel comfort from what had
happened and he was right. Silas felt much better after connecting to Blackwater, he left
to go back to the swamp and was at peace. He wasn't constantly thinking about how his
parents died or how he was alone. Silas was okay for a while until the side effects
started to hit him. Silas started to hear a voice in the back of his head that sounded like
his fathers that was constantly tormenting him. At first it wasn't too bad so he tried to
ignore it and did for many years. Silas grew distant from many people who he would
frequently be around including Basil.<br>
Around when Silas was 450 he eventually wasn't able to ignore the voice in his
head and grew more aggressive like his father did. Silas still went to the council
meetings but would distance himself from everyone until the meeting started and he
would be silent for most of it. After one of them Silas fully lost himself to Blackwater after
Juggernaut made a comment about how Silas had become just like his father. That
comment broke Silas mentally and lost it but proved Juggernaut right. He used
Blackwater to cast forcecage around the two of them and Silas beat Juggernaut within
an inch of life and only stopped after he saw everyones reactions to what he had done.
Silas left and isolated himself in the swamp to only come out when he was needed for a
meeting. Silas at this point started killing anyone who would enter the swamp unless
they were a dragon and would tell them to leave. Basil would come and try to help Silas
but he wouldn't listen and told him that he just wants to be alone.<br>
Coming to near the end of Silas life he felt truly alone. He knew at this point he
had nothing and no one. He realized this after he killed Brutus’s fiance and it wasn't
killing him that did it, it was the look of terror Eos gave Silas that made him remember
what happened to him. Silas took the body of Brutus’s fiance and Eos out of the swamp
near Basil’s territory where he let out a roar and left. Silas after that point was conflicted
with Blackwater and was hurting himself because of it. Silas was fighting himself about
letting go of Blackwater but every time he did the excruciating pain was unbearable that
he couldn't let go. Around this point a group of villagers came to loot Silas' hoard they
didn't find much but they took Erya’s sword and necklace which was the only thing Silas
had left of his mother. Enraged he destroyed the village and interrogated the leader to
where the items went and got no answers just pleading to not kill his daughter. Seeing
the girl Silas couldn't pull himself to kill her due to getting a similar look he got from Eos,
so he marked the child with a black rose and left.<br>
Mnymosne saw what Blackwater had done to Silas at this point and she tried to
get it back from him. This resulted in Mnymosne and Silas fighting and Silas was greatly
injured but still had Blackwater. After that a group of silver dragon knights being led by a
human named Lucian came to kill Silas and with Silas in his weakened state lost and
died. Lucian proceeded to drink Silas blood hoping to gain power from it but due to the
necromantic effects Blackwater had done to Silas’s body he took over Lucians body and
was revived. Silas’s head was clear and hoped to try and gain some assistance for what
had happened and went towards the center city where he was later arrested.</p></div>
